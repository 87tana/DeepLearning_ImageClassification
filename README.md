# Deep-Learning

Here I used **CIFAR-10**, which is a commonly used image classification dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes,
with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, 
the classes include airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
It is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms and deep learning models.
