# Deep learning(keras) Image Classification

- Utilized the CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, for image classification.

- Implemented a Neural Network model using Keras, specifying layers, activations, and optimizer.

- Monitored and analyzed the learning progress of the model using Tensorboard, examining metrics like accuracy and loss.

- Trained the model on the training images to enhance predictive capabilities.

- Assessed the model's performance using a confusion matrix, comparing predictions to ground truth labels.

- Contributed to the advancement of image classification algorithms and deep learning techniques through the use of Keras, Tensorboard, and the evaluation of   the confusion matrix.
