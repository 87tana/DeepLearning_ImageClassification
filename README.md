# Deep-Learning


I employed CIFAR-10, a widely utilized image classification dataset comprising 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes.
Each class contains 6,000 images. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, encompassing categories such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. 
CIFAR-10 serves as a prevalent benchmark for evaluating image classification algorithms and deep learning models.
